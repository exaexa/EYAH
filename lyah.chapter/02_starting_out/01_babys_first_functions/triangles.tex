\exercise{}{Triangle}{
Write a function that, given three numbers, checks whether they can be lengths
of the three edges of a triangle (using triangle inequality). Return a Boolean
value.
}
\exercise{}{Triangle 2}{
Check whether the triangle has a right angle.

Add some small tolerance to the comparison, if necessary.
}
\exercise{}{Triangle 3}{
Suppose the triangle does not have a right angle, but is quite close to it. If your function parameters are named as the correspondings lengths $a,b,c$, return a name of the angle that is closest to being right.

E.g. \texttt{rightestAngle 5.01 3 4} should return \texttt{"alpha"}.
