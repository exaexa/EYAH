\exercise{}{Triangle}{
Write a function that, given three numbers, checks whether they can be lengths
of the three edges of a triangle (using triangle inequality). Return a Boolean
value.
}
\exercise{}{Triangle 2}{
Given three lengths of triangle edges, write a function that checks whether the
triangle is right (\ie has a right angle.)

Add some small tolerance to compensate for the possibility that the user inputs
the numbers rounded to 3 decimal places.
}
\exercise{}{Triangle 3}{
Suppose the triangle is not right, but is quite close to it. If your function
parameters are named as the correspondings lengths $a,b,c$, return a name of
the angle that seems closest to being right.

\Eg\texttt{rightestAngle 5.01 3 4} should return \texttt{"alpha"}.

\texttt{rightestAngle 7 6 6} can return any of \texttt{"beta"} and
\texttt{"gamma"}.
