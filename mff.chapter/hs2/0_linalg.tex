\exercise{}{Vector multiplication}{
Using \texttt{zipWith} and \texttt{foldr}, write a function that computes a
vector product of two numerical vectors represented as lists.
}
\exercise{pencils=1}{Folds}{
Find out (from the Internet) the differences between \texttt{foldr},
\texttt{foldl} and \texttt{foldl'}.

Which of them is best for processing infinite data? Which is best for finite
numerical operations (just as the vector multiplication)? Which of them can
terminate the processing in the middle of the list?
}
\exercise{}{Matrix multiplication}{
Using \texttt{map}, \texttt{head}, \texttt{tail} and the previously-defined vector multiplication, define a function that multiplies matrices represented as lists of lists.
}
\exercise{stars=1}{Matrix multiplication 2}{
If you did not do it already, try to simplify your matrix multiplication code using definitions \texttt{heads=map head}, \texttt{tails=map tail}, \texttt{nulls=any null}. Use them to define matrix transposition.
}
