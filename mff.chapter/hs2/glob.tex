\exercise{level=1}{Glob datatype}{%
Define a data type for glob patterns. It is basically a list of elements that
either match an exact character, or act as glob `?' (any one letter), or a glob
`*' (zero to any number of any letters). Write a function \texttt{char2glob}
that converts a single character of a glob pattern to your new datatype.
Converting strings to lists of glob patterns should then be implementable like
this:

\texttt{string2glob = map char2glob}
}
\exercise{level=2}{Glob matching}{%
Write a function \texttt{matchGlob} that takes a glob pattern and a string, and
decides whether the string matches the pattern. Use a recursion scheme that
consumes both the pattern list and the string together.
