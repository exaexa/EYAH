\exercise{level=2}{Nice vectors}{
Take \texttt{data V3 a = V3 a a a}. The auto-derived instance of \texttt{Show}
does not look very mathematical in this case, derive an instance of
\texttt{Show} that displays the vector as 3 elements in square brackets.
}
\exercise{level=2}{Infinity integers}{
Let's enrich the integers with infinity:

\texttt{data InfInt = Finite Integer | PlusInf | MinusInf}

Write an instance of \texttt{Show} that displays finite integers as normal
integers, and outputs something reasonable for the infinite values.
}
\exercise{level=2}{Infinity compared}{
Derive instances for \texttt{Eq} and \texttt{Ord} for the \texttt{InfInt}.
