\exercise{pencils=1}{Mappable tree}{
Implement the \texttt{Functor} instance for the previously-used
(\cref{sec:mff-forestry}) tree datatype.
}
\exercise{stars=1}{Computation complexity}{
Define a type \texttt{OpCnt a} that represents a value of type \texttt{a}
accompanied with a counter that represents how many operations were needed to
compute that value.

Implement its instance of \texttt{Num} that keeps track of the number of
operations required to get the resulting number.
}
\exercise{}{Computation complexity 2}{
Can the operation-tracking type be a functor that would track the number of
externally applied functions? Implement the instance and invent a short example
where the counter reports something fishy.
}
\exercise{pencils=1}{Functors 1 2 3}{
Reimplement functor operators \texttt{(<\$)} and \texttt{(\$>)}. To remain
point-free, consider using \texttt{flip}, \texttt{fmap} and \texttt{const}.
