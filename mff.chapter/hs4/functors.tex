\exercise{level=3}{Mappable}{
The typeclass that implements overloaded function mapping is called
\texttt{Functor} (just as Foldable implements overloaded list-like behavior).
Implement the instance for your tree structure.
}
\exercise{level=3}{Computation complexity}{
Define a type \texttt{OpCnt a} that represents a value of type \texttt{a}
accompanied with a counter that represents how many numerical operations were
needed to compute that number.

Implement its instance of \texttt{Num} that keeps track of the minimal number
of operations required to get the result (this is sometimes called ``expression
depth'').
}
\exercise{level=3}{Computation complexity 2}{
Can the operation-tracking type be a functor that would track the number of
externally applied functions? Implement the instance and invent a short example
where the counter reports something fishy.
}
\exercise{level=3}{Functors 1 2 3}{
Reimplement functor operators \texttt{(<\$)} and \texttt{(\$>)}. To remain
point-free, consider using \texttt{flip}, \texttt{fmap} and \texttt{const}.
