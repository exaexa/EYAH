\section{Expressions, types and type system}

We incrementally try to use types not as restrictions (which do not make sense
in a managed language anyway), but as additional information (theorems for
free!) that helps the compiler shape the resulting program. We go from learning
the STLC and let-polymorphism to some useful properties of typeclasses.
