\exercise{}{Types}{Define a language of types as
$$ T = T \rightarrow T | t_i\qquad(\forall i) $$
Overload the functions for substituting other types and getting free variables
from such expressions.
}
\exercise{}{Substitutions}{Implement a datatype for (multi-variable)
substitution, that is generic over languages and variable identifiers, together
with substitution composing function.}
\exercise{lambdas=1}{Substitutions 2}{You are advised that the substitutions may
behave as monoids. Is substitution composition commutative?}
\exercise{pencils=2}{Unification}{Write a function \texttt{unify} that takes 2
type expression and either fails, or returns a substitution that makes them the
same. Do not forget about occur-check.}
