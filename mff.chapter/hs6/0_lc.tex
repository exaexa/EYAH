\exercise{}{Lambdas}{
Design a simple datatype for storing expressions $\lambda$-calculus,
parametrized by the type of variable identifiers.

The grammar is as follows:
$$ \Lambda \rightarrow \Lambda\Lambda | (\lambda v_i.\Lambda) | v_i \qquad (\forall i)$$
}
\exercise{}{Variables}{
Write a function that extracts all free (unbound) variables of a
$\lambda$-expression.
}
\exercise{pencils=1}{Sets of variables}{
Use Data.Set for the previous exercise, if you didn't do it already.
}
\exercise{}{Unbound variables}{
Write a funciton that generates a String variable name that is not free in
given expression.
}
\exercise{}{Unbound variables 2}{
Write a function that can generate such a variable name for a larger class of
variable-identifier types (e.g. Enum).
}
\exercise{stars=1}{Enumerated identifiers}{
Write an Enum instance that can enumerate string-like variable identifiers (for
easily finding new variable names).
}
\exercise{}{Normal form}{
Determine whether given $\lambda$-expression is in normal form (i.e. it can not
be $\beta$-reduced anymore.
}
\exercise{}{Substitution safety}{
Write a function that performs substitution.

Note that you must not substitute a term with free variable $v$ if the variable
is bound by another binding $\lambda v$ in that context. In that case, change
the variable identifier of the conflicting binding.
}
\exercise{lambdas=1}{Lambda machine}{
Converts a lambda expression to a normal form using $\beta$-reductions. Ensure
that you evaluate the expression lazily --- always starting with the leftmost
possible redex.

Note that this may not terminate in all cases (try with
$\Omega=(\lambda x.xx)(\lambda x.xx)$).
}
\exercise{lambdas=1,stars=1}{Limited lambda machine}{
Write a similar function that stops if a normalized expression is not reached
after given number of $\beta$-reductions.
}
\exercise{}{Logicians kindof love integers!}{
$\lambda$-integers are represented as iterative function appliers:
$n \simeq (\lambda fx.f^n x)$. For example, number 3 is represented as
$(\lambda fx.f(f(f x)))$.

Write a function that converts Haskell integers to $\lambda$-integers.
}
\exercise{}{Integer terms 2}{
Write a function that converts $\lambda$-expressions that look like
$\lambda$-integers to \texttt{Maybe Integer}.
}
\exercise{stars=1}{Integer terms 3}{
Implement addition as $(\lambda abfx.(af)(bfx))$,
multiplication as $(\lambda abf.a(bf))$
and exponentiation as $(\lambda ab.ba)$.

Write a function that computes $a^2+2ab+b^2$ and compute that for
$(a,b)=(3,4)$.
}
\exercise{pencils=1}{Efficiency first}{
Measure the number of $\beta$-reductions required to run the previous
computation.
}
\exercise{pencils=1,stars=1}{EfficiencyM}{
Beancounting from the previous exercise makes a good reason for using a State
monad. Rewrite the evaluating functions counters to \texttt{State Integer}.
}
