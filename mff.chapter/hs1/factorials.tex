\exercise{level=0}{Factorial}{
Write a function that computes a factorial accordingly to the mathematical definition: If the number is less than 2, factorial is 1, else the factorial is number-times factorial of the number decreased by 1.

If you used \texttt{if} keyword, compute the factorial without using it. If you did not, try it with \texttt{if} --- just for the practice.
}
\exercise{level=0}{Factorial 3}{
Knowing the benefits of tail recursion, rewrite the factorial function to tail-recursion form (using an accumulator) called \texttt{fac'}. Hide its definition in \texttt{fac}.
