\exercise{level=0}{Sums}{
Write a function that sums up a list of number (equivalent of the standard \texttt{sum}).
}
\exercise{level=0}{Products}{
Write a function that multiplies a list of number together (equivalent of the standard \texttt{product}).
}
\exercise{level=0}{Folding}{
Looking at the resulting definitions of previous two exercises, notice that
they have something in common. Write a function \texttt{reduce} that captures
this common part, an allows you to define previous functions as
\texttt{sum l = reduce (+) 0 l} or
\texttt{product l = reduce (*) 1 l}.
