\exercise{level=4}{Maze}{
Use the StateM to simulate a maze of size 10x10 with walls and empty space
(defined by any 2D structure you like) that contains a random guy inside
(defined by his position).

Implement functions for moving the guy in the four directions that do not do anything if there is a wall or and end of the maze.
}
\exercise{level=4}{Pathfinder}{
Write a function that computes the shortest path to some marked exit, then
executes the path plan to actually move the guy there. Use \texttt{mapM\_}.
}
\exercise{level=4}{Sokoban}{
Add movable stones to the maze and reimplement the movement functions.
