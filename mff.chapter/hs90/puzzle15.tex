Solve the 15 puzzle --- 15 numbered square tiles randomly positioned in a 4x4
square with one `hole', where you are supposed slide the tiles around (using
the space given by the hole) to permute them back to a sorted sequence.

Use a reasonable heuristic:
\begin{itemize}
\item Measure the sum of distances of the tiles from their target positions and
explore the most promising moves first.
\item Reduce search breadth. Solve the first row first, then stop touching it
and solve the second row, etc.
\end{itemize}

Note that half of the permutations can not be solved.
