Write a function that parses a regular expression string that may contain:
\begin{itemize}
\item single characters
\item any character mark (dot, `.')
\item parentheses
\item or (`|')
\item Kleene star
\end{itemize}
The function produces a new function of type \texttt{String -> Bool}, which
answers whether given string matches the original regular expression pattern.

Do not care about escaping of regular expression tokens. Also do not care about
matching complexity --- it is expected to be exponential in ugly cases.
