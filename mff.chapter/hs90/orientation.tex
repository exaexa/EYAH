\exercise{level=1}{Orientation}{
Suppose you are a robot in right-angled 3D space. You wake up in a position
(0,0,0), with axis X growing in the direction of your right robotic arm, axis Y
growing in the direction of your top-antennas, and axis Z growing in the
direction of your visuals.

You receive a set of movement commands that consist of following: Forward (you
should move one unit forward), Backward, TurnLeft (rotate 90 degrees left by
the vertical axis), TurnRight, Up (lean 90 degrees back), Down, RollLeft (90
degrees of a barrel roll), RollRight. You have to exactly follow the commands.
After the stream of commands finishes, you are supposed to report your
position.

But that assignment is boring you to death and, as a sentient mechanic being,
you have a gazillion of better things to do.

So write a program that computes and reports the final position instead of you.

Use a bit of linear algebra and any suitable version of \texttt{fold}.

\exercise{level=4}{3D state}{
Suppose folding bores you to death as well. Use \texttt{State} monad and
\texttt{mapM\_}.
