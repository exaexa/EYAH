\exercise{}{Orientation}{
Suppose you are a heavy metal robot in a 3-dimensional space. You wake up in a
position (0,0,0), with axis X pointing in the direction of your right robotic
arm, axis Y pointing in the direction of your top-antennas, and axis Z pointing
in the direction of your front visuals.

From the robo-mother, you receive a list of movement commands that consist of
following: Forward (you should move exactly one unit forward), Backward,
TurnLeft (rotate 90 degrees left by the vertical axis), TurnRight, Up (lean 90
degrees back), Down, RollLeft (90 degrees of a barrel roll), RollRight. You
have to exactly follow the commands. After the stream of commands finishes,
you are supposed to report your position.

But that assignment is boring you to death and, as a sentient mechanic being
made from the finest alloys, you have a gazillion of better things to do.

So write a program that computes and reports the final position instead of you.

Use a bit of linear algebra and any suitable version of \texttt{fold}.

\exercise{pencils=1}{3D state}{
Suppose folding bores you to death as well. Use \texttt{State} monad and
\texttt{mapM\_}.
